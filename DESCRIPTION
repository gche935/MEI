Description: This package provides a collection of functions for testing configural, metric, and scalar invariance, as well as comparing latent means and defined parameters. Applied to multiple groups, multiple times in longitudinal studies, multiple sources in congruence research, and multi-level confirmatory factor analysis. Notes: (1) Use 2,000 bootstrapped samples or one million sets of factor loadings and intercepts generated by Monte Carlo simulation based on the parameter estimates and the variance-covariance matrix of the freely estimated factor loadings and intercepts in the configural invariance model (or partial metric invariance model), and the confidence intervals of differences in factor loadings and intercepts between groups are calculated. (2) When more than two groups are tested for ME/I, for each combination of reference item and argument, first compares each pair of groups using a Type I error rate of 0.01 or 0.001, then applies the list-and-delete method to identify the set of invariant groups. (3) After identifying the sets of groups with invariant factor loadings or intercepts in each pair of reference and argument items, the model with the least number of freely estimated factor loadings and intercepts (the most parsimonious model with the largest number of invariant items) will be selected. (4) When multiple models have the same number of estimated parameters, the model with the best fit will be selected. (5) Missing values are handled with full-information maximum likelihood. (6) All non-converged and non-admissible boot-strapped samples are removed from the calculations. (7) All the identification of invariant sets is correct up to a maximum of 25 groups. If there are more than 12 sets of invariant groups, the remaining groups will be considered as non-invariant.
